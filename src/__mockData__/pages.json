    "pageContent": "Chapter 1\n\nPosted on June 10, 2016 by crazypumkin\n\nThat day .  A stunning sunny day even though it is the rainy season, puts me in a good mood since morning . \n\nThe train .  Changed once, away from the city, the slightly worn station that can be said to be in a rural area that is only crowded in the mornings and evenings . \n\nDue to school commuting . \n\nMost of the state schools are situated here as the land is cheap . \nLuckily even though I belongs to one of the schools here, the distance is not that I would need to take a bus to from the nearest station . \n\nI will die if I am forced to exercise this much in the morning . \n[TN: It’s just taking a bus…]\n\nCome to think of it I won’t even choose that kind of school in the first place .  Right . \n\nAh .  . But the weather is so good today .  So good that I feel like skipping .  The little sweat I had tells me that summer will soon be coming makes me happy .  Thinking about this as I walk, someone tap me from behind . \n\n” Shou, good morning! ”\n” Ohh! Morning Terao .  ”\n\nEhh .  . Why is it not a girl from my class .  . No, it is not that I am thinking about that kind of stuff .  I am not thinking about it! This guy too . \nTerao . \nMy best friend .  I only came to know him when I entered high school but due to our personality being similar, we got close fast . \n\n” What’s with that face? You must be thinking about something rude like ah, why is it Terao, right? ”\n” Ah .  I was exposed .  ”\n\nI laughed but reality is cruel . \nTerao is popular .  He is what they call an ‘Ikemen’ .  [TN: Handsome]\nI am a troublesome guy? Can’t be helped, that is the kind of guy I am . \n\n” Ah… I am jealous of your looks .  ”\n\nCompared to the sunny sky my heart is drizzling a bit . \n\n” What’s that? Really…you allllllways say that kindof stuff, I’m so tired of hearing it .  ”\n\nTerao said with a serious face .  The daily conversation that is almost a template for us .  To the fact that you can call this as our greeting to each other .  Not discriminating to anyone, friendly, yet not frivolous and kind… That is Terao . \n\nAnd there is me . \n\nI don’t want to admit it but I seems to be hated by the ladies . \n\n[TN: The following paragraph was edited as I misunderstood the meaning . ]\nEvery time I greet them, they would say something in a tiny voice before turning red and running away .  If I ever wanted to chat with them in the classroom, someone will come over and drag them away somewhere .  The former must be that they are angry with me .  The latter must be ” Don’t get close to someone like that! “ .  Damn it . \n\nWhat is so different about me and that guy!?\n\n…The world is unfair . \n\nOh .  While ranting in my heart, Terao is looking at me with a strange look . \n\n” It .  . It’s nothing .  ”\n\nSaying that so suddenly is just like admitting that there is something! But Terao just said ” Okay .  ” with a smile .  I see .  What a gentlemanly response .  Let’s learn it .  As I am nodding that the fact I have a good example by my side…\n\nA vase fell . \n\n…hm? Eh?\n\n◆\n\nThe vase hit my head directly . \n\nThe world started spinning in slow-motion . \nThe vase touched the top of my head, and as pressure was felt, the skull cracked . \n\nI died…!\n\nAs I am thinking that, my eyes open to a field of flowers all around me .  What is happening? That’s right .  I was hit on the head by a vase .  And I woke up in a field of flowers . \n\nRight .  I don’t want to admit it but I have to .  I died because of a vase .  And this is heaven?\n\nWait .  But .  What about the wheel of reincarnation or King Enma or the last judgement? [TN: I like the name EnmaEnma so I’m not gonna use Hades . ]\nDying is surprising boring . \nBut because I died by a vase, I don’t really want to wake up amidst a field of flowers .  Why is everything flowers? Don’t tell me this is a hint about my entire life? My head is not full of flowers!\nAnd I started a meaningless retorts with myself .  While I am doing that, the field of flowers disappears, leaving behind a white space all around . \n\n” I am really so sorry!! ” [TN: He’s doing old man speak]\n\nAnd suddenly someone jumped and kneel in front of me…An old man . \n[TN: He is doing dogesa]\nErm… What is with this situation?\n\n” Erm, what is happening? Please raise your head .  ”\n\nFor now, just accept the situation and even though I have no idea what I should do, I would really like an explanation first .  To understand the situation . \n\n” You forgive me? ”\n\nWith my words that holds such thoughts, the old man raises his head, eyes sparkling . \n…Displeased . \nI am not feeling happy despite I am in heaven .  The fields of flowers, this kneeling old man, is this harassment? Are you making fun of me?\n\nThe subtle unpleasantness continues .  Then a thought pops up that makes me pale .  Nothing good is happening, and everything unpleasant keeps on happening… Don’t tell me this is hell… . ?\n\n” Here is neither heaven or hell .  ”\n\nAs my thoughts progresses, the kneeling old man stood up saying .  Have you stop apologizing? Although I have no idea why you are apologizing, seeing how desperate you are means something really bad happened .  Your attitude sure changes fast . \n\nI looked at the old man .  Touching my lips, it seems like I did not absent-mindedly spoke my thoughts out loud .  Which means this old man is reading my thoughts?\n\n” I am not a human but a god .  ”\n\n…For real?\n\nMy jaw dropped .  And I began looking around the room .  All I can see is white, white, white .  A white space .  Like how snowing countries got attacked by a snow storm and renders everything white .  This is not anot a space that can be man-made . \n\nAh…This is for real…\nI sigh at the space that confirmed the old man’s words . \n\n” Please don’t tell me…that I died because of .  . you? ”\n\nThat’s what happened in the web novel that I was hooked up with reading .  It cannot be that right, I laugh bitterly . \n\n” Yes, it is my fault .  ”\n\nFor some reason he puffed out his chest . \n…This guy… .  . He is definitely not regretting about this!\n\n” Would you like to hear the reason? ”\n\nIt is like the audio channel is different or something but I can’t make a sound .  [TN: I have no idea what this means in japanese .  Help?]\nI sigh . \n\n” Eh… Ah, my beard caught onto the plants with my knowing .  .  ”\n\n……His beard . \n\nThe reason for my death is his beard, that long beard of his . \nIf god is involve with a death doesn’t it usually means that there is some special reason?!\nAnd it turns out to be his beard! Isn’t this too half-assed? Oi! That was a bit too much . \n\n“… .  . And? What should I do? ”\n\nI hug my head, giving up . \n\n” … . You accept that pretty fast .  ”\n\nGod said, shocked as he looked at me with eyes peeking from underneath his long eyebrows . \n\n” Ah .  . It’s meaningless .  I can’t smile and forgive you for me being killed as I am angry .  I mean, if I make a ruckus then are you going to send me back? ”\n\nAt that, God looked at me, still shocked .  I mean, a being that is God knelt and apologized to me .  If he can send me back then he would have done so in the first place . \n\n” Even so, normally one would still fight against this fact .  ”\n\nAh .  Is that right . \nIt must be because I am a lonely existence . \n\nMy sigh got seen by God . \n\n” And, what’s gonna happen to me? ”\n” Even though it was my mistake which killed you, I cannot bring you back to life .  It would be either to reincarnateeither to reincarnate or disappear .  Do you know anything about the wheel of reincarnation? ”\n” I’ve heard about it… ”\n\nSouls of the dead is guided by the wheel of reincarnation and return to the world with a different life, that kind of stuff .  In short, a new life . \n\nGod, who is looking at me, nod with satisfaction .  He must have read my mind and know that my knowledge is correct .  I am surprised that reincarnation really exist but hey, sure . \n…But I am not disappearing! That’s horrible!\nAgainst reincarnation you made the other choice to be disappearance .  .  You are really… There is no choice in the beginning isn’t it!\n\n” … .  .  I’ll reincarnate .  ”\n\nAt that answer, God nodded deeply and said ” This time really… “ .  I did not pay attention to most of it but it ends with ” To truly apologize, I will grant you any of your wishes .  ”\n\nIsn’t this the famous [Cheat] around the net? Magic cheat, strength cheat, different kinds of cheat floats around my head but there is not one that really appeals to me .  Plus, all the main characters who possess these talents often get lead into troublesome situations . \n\nAnd it is not that I yearn to be unparalleled .  If you asked me what I want, I wanted to be liked, to be loved .  Is that aim too high .  . ? Right .  . hmm .  .  at least I don’t want to be hated like I am now .  . \n\nThere are things in life where I did wrong and failed .  Should I make use of my experience?\n\n” I want to have all of my memories of this former life .  ”\n” Is that all? ”\n” If I ask too much it’s scary .  ”\n\nI laugh bitterly . \nTongue-Cut Sparrow is the biggest trauma from my childhood . \n[TM: It’s a folktale, search it up . ]\n\n” I see .  ”\n\nGod smiles gently upon hearing that . \n\n” And so .  Let’s be on your way .  ”\n\nAt that, my body is wrapped in a warm glow ."

    "pageContent": "Chapter 10\n\nA few months had passed since I can lift my head up .  Just a little more to go before I turn 1 .  I learned to stand and could now use my hands to grab stuff .  I also came to know more about this world .  For example, this world does not have a name .  Thinking about it, it is not all that weird .  My previous world is named ‘Earth’ but that is actually the name of a planet, and not the actual name of the world . \n\nMeh, all that I learned are all from the books I can read anyway . \n\nFor one, there is magic in this world!\n\nYep .  I had thought the story in the Picture Book was ridiculous but it turns out to be a rather famous fairy tale .  In short, magic exists in this world and everyone can use it! Although talent is another thing . \n\nMy excitement just soar through the roof when I learned about it .  I am sure anyone will agree with me feeling like shouting ‘HERE IT IS!!! ‘ . \n\nAnd so, from today, I will be experimenting .  Even though the maids are going to run around looking for me, who had escape from the crib [TN: Original text is futon], but I don’t care! I have a huge duty now!\n\n” Alrighty! ”\n\nSitting in the library alone, I feel my excitement rising as I hold a book in my hand .  [TN: Counteraction raising! We say WOW WOW WOW WOOOW . ]\n\n『Magic That Even Monkeys Understand     Elementary』\n\nWhat a title .  You don’t know if the author is trying to make a pun or not .  It is really amazing that this book, with a title that treats people like idiots, is compress of the eternal dreams Earthlings ever had .  Excited, I opened the book and begin to slowly, carefully read it . \n\n” Yep,yeup .  ”\n\nThat is not me fumbling with my words . \n\n『 The basics of Magic\n1 .  Let’s Sense Magic : Mana is all around you and in you . \n2 .  Let’s Manipulate Magic : Ifyou can feel the mana, imagine it flowing .  After getting used to it, try gathering it in your hand . \n3 .  Let’s try Using Magic : Mana and Incantations are needed .  To know more about Incantations, please go to the next page ‘Chapter 2 : Incantations’! 』\n\nYep, yep .  How orthodox!\nThis is really fantasy! I mean, it is word for word from the web novel I read!\n…The imagination of Earthlings is incredible . \n\nAnd so, I started to practice according to the book .  As I had my previous memories, I had already grasp the meaning of point 1 .  This warm feeling inside and outside must be ‘Mana’ . \n\nAnd erm…Next is to imagine the flow…\nIt is like I grew a new organ .  Kinda like ‘I grew a 6th toe!’ .  Anyway, even if the mana is drifting about, a part of me can still recognize it . \n\nHm…hm .  . hmmmm…\n\nAs I am having trouble with it, suddenly I feel like a nerve had been unlock and the Mana starts moving . \n\nYes, here it comes!\n\nThis must be what they mean by feeling the flow .  I feel like ClaXX from HeiXX, GiXX Of The Alps .  This must be the same feeling as how XXare first being able to walk . \n[TN: Classic Japanese Anime, Hedi, Girl of the Alps . ]\n\n” Mumumu… ”\n\nFor the first time, I gathered Mana, which feels ticklish yet soft – a very unusual sensation, into my hand .  The temperature of it is not hot, yet it feels warm .  Is Mana something like life force? The warmth it produces feel like the life force, or part of it . \n\nI scattered the gathered Mana and turn to the next page . \n\n『 ~Chapter 2 : Incantations~\nTo activate magic, either incantations or Magic formation is needed .  Chantless       incantation exists but those needs a freaking amount of Mana!\nAnd now, you would need to know your attribute .  It’s important!\nAs so as not to dry up you Mana, let’s remember the incantations . \nMagic formations is also written in this book, try it if you are free . \nBut it is difficult to draw, and if you have the time to draw, saying it will be loads faster so incantations is recommended ☆ 』\n\nWhat is with this this introduction? What a flippant attitude .  I mean, ‘ .  . recommended ☆’… My sight shifted down the page . \n\n…Eh?\n\n[Fire]…?\n\nI started to doubt my eyes .  The formation and incantation that is written is in Japanese no matter how you see it .  No, it cannot be .  I looked at the explanation . \n\n『 [Fire] : Pronunciation faɪə(r) [TN : Japanese, He .  Guys, would you rather I put the Japanese pronunciation? PS: Fire is in kanji, 火]\nTo create fire .  Depending on the amount of mana you use, the output will be different .  Beginner = This! Let’s try doing it immediately! 』\n[TN: Harry Potter spells book this is not . ]\n\nYep, it is not my eyes .  LOL Japanese .  LOL Kanji . \n\nWhat is this double standards . \n\nI was stunned for a few seconds but bouncing back quick is one of the few good traits I possess . \n\nI pulled myself together and started reading the detailed explanation . \n\n『 First, things to note before chanting! Everybody’s attribute is different .  The basis is 1 attribute per person, if you have 2, let’s go, court’s level! For magic outside your attribute, if you find yourself unable to activate it even with incantations or it ends up shabby, don’t be disappointed! There is always the next time! Don’t go bluffing yourself that you got the incantation wrong .  』\n\nWhat is it with this tone? It is really annoying . \nOoh, the basic attributes are Fire, Water, Earth, Wind…, and Light, Shadow, Air etc .  There is even unidentified attributes .  The research being done on that is freaking difficult so that is unrelated to monkeys . \n\n…Oi, author, what the heck are you doing .  It is horrible how you treat readers like monkeys .  Yes, I know the title of your book is ‘Magic Even Monkeys Can Understand’ .  Even so!\n\n…Whatever .  Let’s pull myself together and try doing it!\n\nPretending to be cool, I did a meaningless cough .  I I then stretched out my hand and started to gather mana the size of a ping-pong ball . \n\n” [Fire] ”\n\nI chant, looking at the ball of mana .  With a ‘Pong!’, a fireball the size of a ping-pong ball appears in the air . \n\nHere it is!!!!!!!!\n\nCongratulations!! Thank you!!\nI can use magic!\n\nIn my excitement, the fireball begin to fell .  …Opps, how dangerous…\nCalming myself, I begin analyzing .  First of all, it looks like my attribute is Fire .  I am relived .  I did think about me failing to use magic .  Come to think of it, all of the novels I read talks about the importance of imagination . \n\n” [Fire] ”\n\nOnce again, I gather mana the size of a ping-pong ball in my hands, using imagination as I chant .  Then, a loud ‘poof!’ and a fireball the size of a volley ball appears!\n\n” Wah! ”\n\nShocked, I extinguished the fire ball .  Because, this body of mine is still at the level of a 1 year old! Holding a fireball the size of a volley ball is too close to my face!\n\nBut as thought, imagination is important .  Coming to understand that, I gathered mana in the air instead of my hand this time round .  Which reminds me, if I add oxygen carefully, will the flame turn blue? Let’s try .  I imagine a gas burner as I chant and as I thought, a blue flamed fireball appears . \n\n” Ewsome! ”\n\nI exclaimed unintentionally .  Yep, I did not fumble with my words .  I begin to wonder if the fireball can be moved and I tried moving it . \nIt is looking like the haunted houses in a theme park ♪\n\nAs I am having fun experimenting, time is ticking away .  It is about time to return to my room or people are really going to get worried .  I looked outside the window and checked the position of the sun .  It is time for lunch~ Lunch~♪\n\nBut I got caught up in the moment and make a dragon shaped fireball .  Please don’t say anything chuunibyo like a fire dragon!\n\nI opened the door a little to check if anyone is in theis in the corridor before I went out of the library .  Ah, even if I called it a library, it is just one of the rooms in the house .  Mah, it does have bookshelves that reaches all the way to the ceiling . \n\nAfter this I would not need to sneak out of my room for a while .  I can just train in my room!\n\n \n\n◆\n\n \n\n” My, Will! Where are you gone all this time~! ”\n\nMother was there when I returned .  In the room next to the bedroom . \n\n” Really…Being so alike to that person in places you really do not need to be .  ”\n\nMother said, signing while sporting a happy look .  That pierce deep into my heart .  I know…I have this plain-looking face…but to say that to a 1 year old…\n\n” Mather .  ”\n\nI said, trying to lift myself up . \n\n” Yes, Will? ”\n” Can chu use machic? ”\n\nI sound awkward and like an idiot but I am trying! Seeing that I am a 1 year old please give some leeway!\n\n” Oh my, why all of a sudden? ”\n\nMother was a little shocked at the question . \n\n” Becasue, it is witten in the pictchu book .  ”\n\nWhatever works . \n\n” Arara, it is because of that you went out? ”\n\nMother crouch down, looking amused . \n… . Damn it, my mother is gorgeous .  Trying to hid my feeling, I nod . \n\n” Is that so? That is my Will! ”\n\nMother stroke my head delightfully .  Even though this inner me is a high scholar who felt a little embarrassed, it felt really pleasant so I had a silly smile on . \n\n” Haha .  ”\nLaughing to hid my embarrassment, Mother lifted her hand that stroked me . \n\n” [Water]! ”\n\nShe chanted .  Why all of a sudden?!\n\n” Wahhhhh! ”\n\nI cried, emotional .  Let’s move aside the fact that Mother always does things suddenly . \nRather than that, it was beautiful .  The water produced from magic, is floating in the air . \n\n” It is too soon to be surprised .  ”\n\nMother laughed as she looked at me . \n\n” Your father is so much better .  ”\n\nEh…for real?\n\n \n\n◆◆◆"

    "pageContent": "Chapter 100\n\n\nShiro, who had been mumbling all this while, let out a breath before leaning onto me .  He’s heavy . \n\n” Oi Shiro .  What are you doing? ”\n\nMy voice came out dangerously low but Shiro looked like it did not concerned him at all .  No, I was not unhappy about this difference in height at all, nope . \n\n… .  . Oi, why was I not even touching his waist? Or rather, your legs were too long, baka . \n\n” Lack of oxygen… ”\n\nSaying that, Shiro then proceeded to leave his entire weight onto my head .  If I was just a normal 8 year old kid, I was pretty sure my neck would be bending at an odd angle by now .  Which summoned beast would harmed his owner’s body like this? … .  . No, if it was Shiro, he most definitely knew what I was capable of before doing it .  What bad taste . \n\nBut, thanks to Shiro’s action, the sparkling eyes filled with pure admiration that was causing me to itched all over the place soon died down .  If this was what Shiro was aiming for, then my valuation of him had to change . \n\n… .  . The him who was humming a song while shaking his butt… No, not possible . \nAfter clearing my head of those thoughts, I returned to the topic, ignoring Shiro . \n\n” And that’s why, how about doing a collaboration with our summoned beast? ”\n” Sounds good! ”\n” I agree! ”\n” Wonderful! ”\n\nAt my suggestion, the 3 of them agreed happily . Then looking at each other with a happy grin on their faces, they took some distance from each other . \n\nAfter getting into their position as if they were surrounding me, they nodded, satisfied, before facing outside, taking something out .  They then proceeded to gather mana and when they had gathered enough, they shouted . \n\n“”” 《召喚》! “””\n[TN: Shokan, summon]\n\nCute ‘pop’ like sound sounded before the magic x 3 began to activated at the same time .  It seemed like the thing that they took out just now were magic circles drawn on a sheet of paper to help aid them in summoning their beasts . \n\nLooking at the unruly head of red hair, he pounced straight towards a dog that appeared while looking like it was swimming in the air, crashing into the ground .  … . Zen .  I know you missed him, I do .  Really, you don’t feel embarrassed at all, do you?\n\nAn unusual sense of admiration came over me .  That was because I did not possessed that ability . \n\nSince it was dangerous for his head, I used wind magic to absorbed the shock .  Like a certain princess in a certain castle, Zen floated in the air for a bit before floating down, gently .  As for his dog… .  his summoned beast, Dogg, was licking his face all over as it’s tails wagged hard, like rotating blades . \n\nI turned to the others .  Well then, if I remembered correctly, Selphy summoned beast was a Bird species beast, Asuka .  … . No, the reason why I did not saw it the first timetime was not because I found it tiresome .  It’s that, you know .  I had to controlled my beast .  Yep . \n\nA gust of wind blew and a beautiful greenish bird appeared .  Selphy’s beautiful green hair was dancing in the wind .  The little bird flew high into the sky, before turning around immediately and landed on Selphy’s shoulder . \n\n” Gruuuuuuu… .  ”\n\nThe bird chirped happily as they looked each other in the eye .  Selphy, as though embarrassed to be looked in the eye, smiled bashfully . \n\n… . Yep, how cute .  Too cute, damn it . \n\nI had to say again, I am not a lolicon .  An elf with her green hair dancing in the wind while smiling at her pet bird, a beautiful elf, surrounded by the forest! Only beautiful and cute could described it! Those that don’t felt it must had something wrong .  They need a doctor . \n\n” ……cough ”\n\nI coughed and tore my eyes away to another spot .  To Mi .  I knew about Zen and Selphy’s beast but I left for the ‘secret mission’ before I even found out what Mi’s was .  I wondered what he summoned .  As I looked over with anticipation, Mi was already greetings with his summoned beast .  They both bowed to each other before shaking hands . \n\n” I will be relying on you .  ”\n” Gigigigiii .  ”\n\nMi said to which his beast answered him . \n\n” Oh, so Mi’s summoned beast is a monkey .  ”\n\nI said, and the both of them turnedthem turned towards me .  Monkey, as it’s name suggested, was a monkey-like beast .  But the color of their fur was not the same as Earth, they possessed all sorts of colors . \n\n” Um .  Aiki the monkey .  ”\n\nMi said, introducing his beast proudly .  And Aiki, sitting on Mi’s shoulder, puffed it’s chest out and looked proud .  Aiki had a deep blue coat and his short fur make him looked really cute .  I wondered if his fur felt like velour .  Maybe it’s still young, it was really quite small in size, just like a lemur, and very cute . \n\nI felt like stroking it .  To ruffle it’s fur . \n\nAnd as I was thinking of it, our eyes met and it quickly hid behind Mi’s back .  Maybe my enthusiasm was too strong and it scared him .  It looked to be a wild monkey so maybe they were sensitive to these kind of feelings . \n\nI need to control myself . \n\nAs I reflected upon it, I waited for the next chance .  If I can hide my feelings good enough, I might be able to stroke it the moment it let it’s guard down .  Hm? Why was I not quitting? There was no way I could .  How could I, after seeing that soft fur?\n\nThe dog that would made all mofu mofu believers swoon, the cute Dogg was licking Zen’s face . \nThe natural beauty that was everlasting, Selphy and her bird, was looking at each other . \nThe soft and velvety fur of the cute monkey with it’s proudwith it’s proud face and Mi who was enjoying it’s presence . \n\n \n\nAnd then, there was the me, who was being leaned on by my summoned beast . \n\n \n\nOi, wait a minute . \nInstantly, I darted out from under Shiro and pointed at him .  There was lot about our tactics I need to discussed about but I had to deal with this first . \n\n” Shiro! Your cuteness level is hideously low! Soothing and healing therapy! Give me some soothing and healing therapy! ”\n\nMy soul was crying out loud . \nI was not wrong for wanting to be healed! I was totally not happy about having a ikemen leaning on me at all! I don’t have that kind of hobby!\n\nAt my words, Shiro looked like he realized something and clapped his hands together . \n\n” I got it! That must be an order from master to cross-dre… .  .  ”\n” NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! ”\n\nI gave my all in shutting Shiro’s mouth, which was saying something weird again .  When will this cross-dressing gag ever end… .  .  My head hurt .  I then let out a deep sigh, before lifting my head up . \n\n” Since our summoned beasts are all here, let’s us start our strategy meeting .  ”\n\nI could only give up . \nOn my healing . \nYep, but once I go home, my mofu mofu-sama would be waiting for me! I still have Chiffon! She would definitely allow me to hug her while smiling sweetly!\n\nAs my heart sobbed, I put out a smiling face . \nI won’t lose! Not for the tournament, and not for everything else either! Yep!"

    "pageContent": "Chapter 10            We somehow managed to get 8 subjects .   Now that we can finally begin moving forward with the plan, I’m a bit reluctant .   Amagi has recently been acting without consulting anyone .   It concerns me .  Some of the subjects are company employees, but we’ve also involved some students .   The results from the previous incident dictate that interfering with the A . I .  Aura is dangerous .   Still, no matter how compatible someone is, students are unrelated .   At any rate, regardless of the results, we must avoid harming the subjects .   With Amagi also participating as a subject, I like to believe she also desires minimizing the risks .   Day One, We decided to extend the length of regular maintenance for this .   We didn’t begin by using general P . C . [1]  Each person logged in using a P . C .  hosting an epitaph .   With no rejections, the first stage is cleared .  I am participating as a harvest cleric in order to provide assistance to the subjects .   Some of the children are playing net games for the first time and need to be taught the basics .   A week has passed and no particular abnormalities have been detected .   I believe that the members with high precision ratio havenow been gathered, however, I’m writing this down because of a concern .   Off in the distance, the P . C .  controlled by management flickered .   We don’t just need to monitor the subjects, but our fellow staff members as well .   Two students complained about poor health after another week .   Having someone who doesn’t have a gaming habit manipulate a controller for 10 hours a day is unreasonable .   Regardless, this physical fatigue clearly doesn’t stem from avatar possession .   The 2 will be given some rest while the remaining 6 move onto the next stage .   This experiment with avatars has much to offer[2] .   This is the first time such an endeavor has ever been attempted .   I doubt even Amagi can perfectly foresee what will happen from now on .  Earlier, I went to a dungeon with a student who operated a blade brandier .   His P . C .  name is Ikaruga .   He’s a modern day gamer and prefers to play alone rather than in groups .   We didn’t speak much .   I told him to follow my instructions to which he responded, “Yes . ” The epitaph installed in Ikaruga’s P . C .  is the 1st Phase, Skeith .   Its alias is the Terror of Death .  The 8 phases are recorded to have been decomposed by Aura in the previousprevious case .   As according to the manual, I… I increased the mental pressure against Ikaruga .   Whenever a player is psychologically cornered, a possession becomes that much more likely .  I wonder if there is a better method of carrying out this experiment .   We’ve somehow collected personal information on not just him, but his family members as well .   So far, this isn’t an invasion of privacy .   However, if the subject were to learn of these documents, not just this project, but the C . C .  Company itself, would end .                                                    I am carefully pilling up questions and slowly guiding him along .   Doing it like this, I sincerely believe I want to make this clear .   Ikaruga successfully made contact with Skeith 3 days later .   Gorre, Magus, and Fidchell awakened afterwards .   Macha will be difficult as it was once possessed by an A . I .   Tarvos is personally being handled by Amagi .   Its situation is being concealed .  “Document with Password”  (There are a few discrepancies in the factor for Tarvos .   I think something mightsomething might have happened between the designer and Amagi . ) With Amagi not yet making contact with Tarvos, I believe the leadership is being affected .   A month has passed since this project began .   The factor for Innis is starting to affect its player .  She is a student from the same vocational school as Ikaruga .   I often see her speaking to him during breaks .  Her feet go numb .   That shouldn’t happen with the moderate breaks being provided from staying seated .   Yet, she loses feeling from her toes all the way to her calves .  A staff member and I immediately pressed Amagi to investigate if this development was the effect on the Real that I feared .   Amagi surprisingly kept her composure and decided to go to an area with her P . C .   I also worry about Ikaruga, but it seems like I’ll be allowed to partake in today’s assessment .  For some reason, the other staff members and I were excluded from the field transfer .   The area word was conveyed to the system, but I can’t even guess how .   From what I can tell, only 3 people know what is happening .  The girl’s numbness appears to have disappeared upon returning from the area .   Was it the area?  Or did it have something that could heal her?  Various conjunctions were tossed around by thearound by the staff, but they soon became meaningless .  Amagi may have also forbidden Ikaruga’s player from discussing what happened .   His replies were, “I don’t remember,” and “I was too far away . ”  The worst outcome to this project happened 4 days later .   The 8 subjects, including Amagi, didn’t return .   We lost contact with them during the middle of the goddess revival ceremony .   Did they make some sort of contact with the Eight Phases? We later understood that their brains underwent a high voltage load .   While some subjects died, others became comatose .  The family members of the subjects are still being lead to believe that the project has not ended .   Fabricated data is being submitted on the experiment’s progress .   Nobody knows about these victims .   Any further information reported on the R . A .  Project is deemed unnecessary .   Continued documentation is terminated .   T/N:  Well, this answers a lot of questions .   The biggest one is how Ikaruga learned about that spring .   I wonder if it’s something created by the system?  Can any  . hack players enlighten us?  The second is about the connection between Ikaruga and Haseo, or more accurately, Ikaruga and Skeith .   Well, there isn’t much more I can say about this chapter .  Thanks for reading,"

    "pageContent": "Chapter 11              \t\t\t\t\t\t\tDivine receives an unexpected, short email, from Yata .   He wants to have Ikaruga and Haseo meet in order to observe what happens .   If Yata is making a move, then he must have come up with something .   She agrees to Yata's proposal and heads for Ikaruga's designated area in Mc Anu, the bridge .   Knowing where to find him is such a time saver .  Divine stops inside the chaos gate dome .   …Except, what kind of reason should I give him? (- . -; )  Considering how he reacted the last time they met, he'll hate this idea .   Ikaruga was assailed by a noise and headache the first time he ran into Haseo .   No one would want to meet such a person .  Divine has those thoughts in mind when she reaches his side .   With a contrived, cheerful voice, she says, \"Ika~ rugaa!\" Ikaruga looks at Divine .   Recently, he has been speaking less and not going to areas as much .   There must be a reason to why he returned to how he first was, but Divine can't think of any .   He stares at her for a few seconds and then looks back at the sunset Divine says, \"Geez, you're not cute at all…\" \"…What was that for?\" Divine thought he'd get angry, but there was no strength behind his words .   His attitude is one filled with nothing but apathy .   She says, \"Aren't you getting rusty not hunting anything these past few days?\" After a few moments, he says, \"…so?\" \"How about going to an area once in a while?  I'll go with you (-ω-)\" Ikaruga glances up towards the sky, then towards Divine .   He says, \"Once, in a while?\" \"Don't you feel like it?\" Ikaruga gives a light nod to Divine's urging .   Ikaruga comes to a stop before the chaos gate .   He places his right hand behind his back as he looks down at Divine .   \"So, where to?\" Divine double checks a copy of Yata's email as she says, \"No need to worry, I've already picked a place out,\" and then inputs the word.  For some reason, Ikaruga appears to be feeling nostalgic .   However, even before this, he should have been able to transfer \"normally\" with this method .  Divine says, \"…?  I'm starting, Ikaruga!\" Faint light glitters from the gate and the two are transferred to the area as Ikaruga gives an absentminded, \"Ye- yeah . \"  They reach a type of grassy plain where the gentle breeze of a sunny day rolls the grass and clouds .   Divine begins looking around as though in search of something .   That's when Ikaruga spots a target and walks towards it .   He speaks in reference to the monster he discovered, \"…Hey, what's the level here?\" \"Etto… about 30  σ(^ω^;)\" The area's level doesn't suit Ikaruga, it is unfit as a hunting ground .   Divine realizes Ikaruga has discovered that their true purpose for being there isn't to level and gives him a mischievous smile .   She knows that giving him an excuse is useless, so she looks Ikaruga in the eye and says, \"There is someone I want you to meet .   I tricked you like this because I was afraid you might not want to meet him if you heard his name .   Sorry . \" Ikaruga stays silent for a while and then gives Divine his back .   \"Who is it you want me to meet?\" Divine's worry that Ikaruga would go back after learning the truth ends as a needless anxiety .   He instead stops looking for monsters and searches for the P . C .   Divine says, \"You've already meet him once, Ikaruga…  His name is [Haseo], an adept rouge .  A wrinkle appears between Ikaruga's eyebrows upon hearing the name, \"Haseo . \"  He remains as calm as he can and says, \"That black adept rouge?\"  They had a coincidental meeting on the bridge and discovered that Ikaruga is assailed by a furious noise and indescribable pain when they're near each other .   Ikaruga has the worst impression possible of him; meeting him is an utter act of foolishness, yet his expression is undisturbed .  Divine notices and grabs his arm before he can change his mind .   \"You'll meet with him?  Then, let's hurry .   He's over this way!\" Ikaruka leansleans forward as he runs due to being pulled by the smaller Divine .   \"He- hey…\"  He stumbles a few times, but doesn't stop as they run across the field .   Divine stops her feet at a hill and looks up at Ikaruga .   \"He's up ahead . \" Ikaruga says, \"…If, the thing from before happens?\" \"Everything will be fine, I'm here for you .   There's another person helping and keeping watch as well . \" Ikaruga takes confidence with Divine's assurance and begins walking up the slope .   Standing at the top with crossed arms is the adept rouge .   His black equipment is such a contrast that the blue sky looks like it was clipped away .  \"You Ikaruga[1]?\"  Haseo has trouble saying Ikaruga's name .  Ikaruga gives a small nod, but makes little effort to close the distance .   One reason is because he's warry of the noise .   As for Haseo, he probably just isn't interested in getting alone with Ikaruga .  Ikaruga speaks after a moment of silence, \"Did you also hear that noise and get a headache back when we first met?\"                                                   \"No, I just happened to be going that way to begin with…  That said, didn't you say, \"Skeith,\" to me?\" Ikaruga barely has any memory from when that noise started back then .   He wasn't able to answer Divine back when she asked him something similar .   He says, \"That Skeith you mentioned, is it something dangerous I need to know about?\" Haseo stares down Ikaruga as he says, \"I don't know if it's dangerous or not, but how do you know the name Skeith?\"  He doesn't have a full grasp on the person… the P . C .  before him .   Yata only told him Ikaruga's name and job along with a rough description of his appearance .   However, since he knows the name of an Avatar, he should also have some sort of connection with the Cthe C . C .  Corporation and be associated with the G . U .  conglomerate .   He might even be an Epitaph user .   So should I really be talking with him about Raven and Avatars?  Ikaruga thinks about Haseo's question for a while before saying, \"I know about it somehow, but I don't know .   It might be intuitive… something I was able to pick up on from a corner of my brain because of that headache . \" Haseo is irked by the response .   Intuitive, in other words, he doesn't know anything about Skeith .   He gives up thinking and scratches his head as he releases a sigh .  Ikaruga then asks a simple question, \"Why did we meet for?\"  It's something he has been wondering about .   They're only two people who spoke a few words on the bridge, after all .  Haseo says, \"Well, in my case, my [boss] told me to come to this area .   You?\" \"Something similar to that . \" Neither of them decided to meet the other of their own free will .   Even the reason for being there is becoming unclear .   The gap between Haseo's eyebrows crease as he realizes and says, \"In that case, neither of us need to be in this place . \"  Didn't Yata say directly meeting with him would be good for talking about the Avatars? Haseo begins taking strides down the hill .   Naturally, he walks towards Ikaruga, but Ikaruga doesn't move .   He either forgot about the noise, or is uncertain and doubts anything will happen .  Ikaruga's negligence is returned to him as he's overwhelmed by pain and noise more potent than the previous time .   He drops down and holds his head on reflex .   His long obi and the hems of his clothes come loose and spread across the green ground[2] .  Haseo stops and drops to a knee to get a better look at Ikaruga's complexion .   After speaking for a bit, he's unable to claim they have nothing to do with each other anymore .   He says, \"Hey, is this that noise again!?\"  He can't tell what is going on with Ikaruga from the outside, but that he's sufferingthat he's suffering is obvious .  The noise prevents Ikaruga from answering .   It sounds is like a sandstorm is scrapping around inside his head .  Haseo clicks his tongue and grasps Ikaruga's shoulders .   His voice might not be able to get through, but he's hopeful a physical touch will .   Instead, the action aggravates Ikaruga's agony .  Ikaruga's hands go from holding his head to falling limp onto the ground .   With his body arched upward and his head tilted back, he gazes at the sky with wide open eyes and say, \"… . I- I'll… \"I'll take it…\" Haseo creates some distance between himself and Ikaruga, yet Ikaruga continues his delirious ramble .   He says, \"I'm, Skeith… Skeith is me…  You're me?[3]\" Yata and Divine appear as though they waiting for that moment .   Yata speaks with an exceedingly composed tone .   He says, \"This… is a stronger reaction than I expected . \"  He's calm stands in complete contrast to the fidgetting Divine at his side .  Haseo turns to Yata and demands an explanation .   \"What the heck is going on with that guy?  What's his relationship with Skeith?\" Divine says, \"…We'll talk back in town .   Right now, protecting that data takes priority . \"  She then transfers away with Haseo before he can ask for further clarification .   Data protection .  Prepare an impenetrable area to completely isolate Ikaruga .  Prevent Skeith's data within Ikaruga from flowing out .   Cracked Sleep 《破られた眠り》  T/N: Well, this chapter was exciting .   A lot is starting to make sense, but I get the feeling 70% of this will be thrown out the window as the story develops and more information is revealed .   I can't wait to see how this contact, literally, with Haseo will affect Ikaruga .  -Gandire Alea  [1] Ikaruga's name is written in Katakana instead of the usual kanji here .  [2] This part was a bit unclear to me: 高さを失った長い帯や裾が、緑の地面に広がった。 [3] I'm not sure if he says me or mine .  「オレが、スケィスで…スケィスがオレで…。お前がオレ？」   12 .  Drifting>"
